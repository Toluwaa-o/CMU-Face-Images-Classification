### Completed with Python, Numpy, Keras, TensorFlow, etc
### Data: [CMU Face Images](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/124/cmu+face+images.zip)

The Data: This data consists of 640 black and white face images of people taken with varying pose (straight, left, right, up), expression (neutral, happy, sad, angry), eyes (wearing sunglasses or not), and size

The Objective: The objective of this project is to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model capable of accurately classifying images into one of twenty different categories. The model will be trained on a dataset consisting of 1000 observations, each labeled with one of the twenty distinct categories.
